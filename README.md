# ATM African FIA Replacement

[ATM African FIA Replacement - Arma Reforger Workshop](https://reforger.armaplatform.com/workshop/624A8B96AA67EFEB-ATMAfricanFIAReplacement)

Spelled out, it's an ArmA Reforger mod that replaces the FIA faction's characters.

The intent of this project is to provide a lightweight and reliable INDFOR solution in a Southern African region environment.

The features I wanted to have right from the start are :
- [x] No dependencies, thus using only Vanilla items.
- [x] Randomized Variants, using the built-in SCR_EditableEntityVariantData script. Here on the Rifleman.
- [x] Tailored loadouts that will let the AI have the tools to give players a run for it. ie. loads of ammo.
- [x] Customized weapons, here the PG7VM rocket.
- [x] Simplicity for the end-user, thus the Replacement way (overrides).

Known issues
- [ ] Sapper. For some reason, the GM mode spawns it as a rifleman. It's fine in the World Editor.
- [ ] The FIA.conf faction file doesn't save the Visual Identity arrays, but the first one.


Future
- [ ] Smarter randomization. I initially went on to randomize the BaseLoadout class, but that didn't work.
- [ ] More uniforms variants, on the other classes than Rifleman.
- [ ] Armament variants.
- [ ] Vehicles.
- [ ] Identities, more fitting than the Czech lore.

What else ?

I'd like to recommend PR9INICHEK's repo [PR9_Random_Loadouts](https://github.com/PR9INICHEK/PR9_Random_Loadouts) which has smart ways of doing it. And I've yet to fully comprehend it!

PS: if you are French speaking and are looking for a mature yet fun team to hang out with, I cannot recommend enough the A-Team. I've known them for years and couldn't be happier to see them still around when I eventually became aware of Reforger being a thing. Being a probie there, I hope that this mention will paint me favorably. :)
